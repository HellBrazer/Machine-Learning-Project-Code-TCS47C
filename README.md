The data scientists at BigMart have collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities for the year 2013. Now each product has certain attributes that sets it apart from other products.

The objective is to create a model that can predict the sales per product for each store. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.
